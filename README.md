## Alterations

This version adopted the
[Open Source Initiative's BSD 3 Clause License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)
as its baseline and applies the following changes:

1. Changed `software` to `product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, etc) without
   needing to spin multiple licenses.
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied.
